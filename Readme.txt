This code is intended to reproduce all results and figures in the manuscript. The code operates on the publicly available data hosted at: https://osf.io/3unka/?view_only=4e7e0d5cee0e4dd9a567fa637644b3b9

Dependencies: MATLAB with parallel computing toolbox.

This code has been tested with MATLAB R2025b on a system running Windows 11 with 32GB RAM. It should work with any recent MATLAB release on Windows.

Instructions:
To run the code reproducing all results and figures:
1. Download the data available at: https://osf.io/3unka/?view_only=4e7e0d5cee0e4dd9a567fa637644b3b9.
2. Run the main function "Tien_et_al_2025_NatCom_Code.m" with the directory where you downloaded the data as input.
	For example, in MATLAB, run: Tien_et_al_2025_NatCom_Code('C:\Users\username\Downloads\Data')

The computationally intensive processing steps have been pre-executed for speed. By default the main function will load the precalculated data and report the results and produce the plots from the manuscript. In order to re-execute the processing steps, edit the file "Tien_et_al_2025_NatCom_Code.m" line 21 to set "recalculate" to "true."

The processed data fields "StretchBoot," "LagBoot," and "FBLBoot" may not reproduce exactly due to random number generator usage.

The functions contained in the repository are described below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Main function:

"Tien_et_al_2025_NatCom_Code.m" - main function that loads data, optionally calls functions to regenerate the processed data, reports results and reproduces plots.


Data processing functions:

"get_Stretch.m" - calculates peri-reach firing rates time-stretched to align to both Reach Start and Reach Ends

"get_StretchBoot.m"* - calculates a random distribution of firing rates for significance testing.

"get_StretchSig.m" - calculates significance of modulation of trial-averaged time-stretched peri-reach firing rates.

"get_Realtime.m" - calculates peri-reach and peri-event firing rates with realtime sampling.

"get_RealtimeSig.m" - calculates significance of modulation of trial-averaged realtime peri-reach firing rates.

"get_Directionality.m" - calculates significance of directional tuning of peri-reach firing rates.

"get_RegressionBuffer.m" - generates data buffers for reach regression analyses.

"get_Lag.m" - calculates lagged reach multiple linear regression results.

"get_LagBoot.m"* - calculates a random distribution of reach multiple linear regression results for significance testing.

"get_LagSig.m" - calculates significance of reach regression results.

"get_ShapLag.m"* - performs Shapley Value Decomposition for reach regressions.

"get_FBRegressionBuffer.m" - generates data buffers for start and end windowed regression analyses.

"get_FBL.m" - calculates lagged start and end windowed multiple linear regression results.

"get_FBLBoot.m"* - calculates a random distribution of start and end windowed multiple linear regression results for significance testing.

"get_FBLSig.m" - calculates significance of start and end windowed regression results.

* These functions are compute-intensive and take a long time to run on most systems.
